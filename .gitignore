# Lock files...
#
# As of August 2024, and a change in the Rust guidance around lock files for libraries
# (see https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/08/29/committing-lockfiles.html), we now source control our
# Cargo.lock file.
#
# This allows our builds to be more reducible, and is a partial mitigation against supply chain attacks.
#
# We also use --locked for all CI builds to ensure these lock files are actually used.
#
# However, this is possibly at the expense of Scrypto users who will have their own Cargo.locks...
# But our Scrypto template now comes with a Cargo.lock template, which should mitigate thi need.
#
# In future, we may wish to add a CI job to build against the latest versions, as per:
# https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/continuous-integration.html#verifying-latest-dependencies
