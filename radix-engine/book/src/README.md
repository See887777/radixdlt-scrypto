# What is Radix Engine?

Radix Engine is a deterministic, transaction-based state machine that updates ledger state by
sequentially executing transactions.

Radix Engine was built out of the lack of Blockchain VMs specifically optimized for a DeFi
shared computing environment in terms of usability, security, performance, and modularity.

Unlike the EVM and other blockchain VMs, Radix Engine:
* Is Object-Oriented and Type-Safe
* Enforces move/ownership semantics
* Has the ability to add system plugins to extend/modify system functionality

## Radix Babylon Network

The Radix Engine running on the Radix Babylon network is a specific system configuration of
Radix Engine which makes asset and auth management a native/core feature of the system.
