# Radix Engine

Radix Engine is a deterministic, transaction-based state machine that updates ledger state by
incrementally executing transactions.

Radix Engine was built out of the lack of VMs specifically optimized for a DeFi shared computing
environment.

Radix Engine is Object-Oriented, enforces ownership/move semantics, and introduces easy "pluggability"
of stateful modules within the system.
