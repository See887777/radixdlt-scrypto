# What is Radix Engine?

Radix Engine is a deterministic, transaction-based state machine that updates ledger state by
incrementally executing transactions.

Radix Engine is Object-Oriented, enforces ownership/move semantics, and introduces easy pluggability
of stateful modules within the system.

# Why?

Radix Engine was built out of the lack of Blockchain VMs specifically optimized for a DeFi
shared computing environment in terms of usability, security, performance, and modularity.
