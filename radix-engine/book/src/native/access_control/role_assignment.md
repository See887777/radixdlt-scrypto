# Role Assignment

On the callee side, instead of roles being assigned to a "user" (of which there is no concept in our decentralized
ledger), roles are assigned through resource ownership. For example, a "Staff" role could be assigned to anyone who
can show proof that they own a "Staff" resource token. This is defined at the callee's Object instantiation
through the [RoleAssignment](../../attached_modules/role_assignment) object module.
