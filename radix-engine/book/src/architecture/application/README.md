# Application Layer

The application layer is responsible for defining high level logic which manipulates 
object state.

An application is defined by a *Package*, which contain zero or more *Blueprints*.
Each blueprint defines object type information and logic which can create/manipulate/destroy
objects of that blueprint type. This logic may then be executed through function calls by other
objects/blueprints.
