# Generics

> **_NOTE:_** Generics are currently only available for use by native packages.

Generics to a blueprint may be specified which will then require an object instantiator to
specify generic parameters during instantiation. Such a generic can then be used in defining function
or state schemas.

Generics in a Blueprint are identified by index.
