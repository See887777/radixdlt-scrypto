# Blueprint Modules

The system may define additional state to be stored per blueprint known as Blueprint modules. If defined, 
every blueprint definition must initialize these modules.

> **_NOTE:_** In [Radix Babylon Network](../../../#radix-babylon-network), there currently
> exists two blueprint modules:
> * [Auth Blueprint Module](../../../native/auth/blueprint_module.md)
> * [Package Royalties Blueprint Module](../../../native/royalties/package_royalties.md)
