# Blueprint

A Blueprint is the Radix Engine equivalent of Classes/Types in Object-Oriented Languages.
It acts as a type identifier for an object and describes shared properties and behavior of
all objects of that blueprint.

Each blueprint has a unique name within its package and are globally identifiable by
`<package_address> + <blueprint_name>`.
