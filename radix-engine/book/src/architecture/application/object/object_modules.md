# Object Modules

The system may define additional state/logic to be stored per globalized object known as
an *Object Module*. 

An Object Module itself has a Blueprint type along with associated logic to manipulate
the state of the object module.

Currently, there exists three object modules:
* RoleAssignment Object Module (Required)
* Metadata Object Module (Required)
* Royalty Object Module (Optional)
