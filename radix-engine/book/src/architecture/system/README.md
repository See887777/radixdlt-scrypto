# System Layer

The System Layer implements the application layer Package/Blueprint/Object abstraction on top of
the kernel Node/Partition/Substate abstraction.

Additionally, the system layer maintains a set of System Modules, or pluggable software, which
extends the functionality of the system. For example, an Auth System Module provides a standard
mechanism for authorization/access control across the whole system.
