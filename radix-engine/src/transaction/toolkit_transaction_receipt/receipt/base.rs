/// The transaction receipt DTO which is used in the communication between the CoreAPI and the Radix
/// Engine Toolkit.
///
/// A core strategy followed by this model and this work stream in general is that we want there
/// to be as little interpretation as possible done by the toolkit and for the core api or whatever
/// service that provides the receipt to provide the toolkit with exactly with the information that
/// it requires.
///
/// This is nice since it means that the data the toolkit needs can be provided through any means
/// the provider sees fit. As an example, the worktop changes are currently derived from the
/// execution trace. There are two options for how the toolkit could get this data:
///
/// 1. It could be given the execution trace and it can derive that data itself from the trace.
/// 2. It can be given that data without needing to worry about its source or how it was derived or
///    obtained.
///
/// The first approach would make it a problem for us to switch to other ways of getting this data
/// while the second approach does not. If we were to switch to events for that then it's a simple
/// change to the core-api to get this data in a different way and it would have no effect on the
/// toolkit.
