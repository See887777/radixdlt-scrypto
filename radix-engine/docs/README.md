# Radix Engine

Radix Engine is an execution engine designed to run DeFi-based Scrypto applications.

Radix Engine is influenced by traditional Kernel design and Rust's Ownership
and Type-Checking paradigms. The novel idea here is in combining ideas from the two worlds,
Operating System and Language, or simply "Implement Rust Semantics at the System Layer".
